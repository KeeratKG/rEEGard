This repository contains the code for rEEGard (**r**obust algorithm for **EEG**-based **a**utomated seizu**r**e **d**iagnosis), a classifier model designed to differentiate between two kinds of epileptic EEG signals, namely focal and non-focal. 

The dataset on which rEEGard was trained, was derived from the open-source [Bern Barcelona Dataset](https://www.upf.edu/web/mdm-dtic/-/1st-test-dataset#.X4mGoXUzbIU). The preprocessed version which was finally used in this project has also been released in this repository.
